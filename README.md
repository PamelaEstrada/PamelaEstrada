Hello everyone, my name is Pamela Estrada. I'm relatively new to the world of data analysis, but I'm incredibly enthusiastic about diving into this field headfirst. Data analysis, to me, is like solving a puzzle where the pieces are numbers and patterns waiting to be discovered. Currently, I'm in the process of learning essential tools like Power BI and Python, which I believe will give me the skills needed to unlock insights from data sets. What excites me the most about data analysis is its potential to uncover valuable insights that can drive informed decision-making and solve complex problems. I'm eager to continue learning and exploring this fascinating realm of data analysis
